A digital camera image is a JPEG, except when it's a raw format, or when it's from an iPhone, or when it's from a pre-1991 camera, or when it's from a 360-camera. Still, the majority of images are JPEGs.

Digital video is more complex. MPEG-4 did not become the standard format across the devices until the mid 2000s. Like professional still photography, professional video photography has its own formats to support more complex workflows. The adaptability of the underlying MPEG-4 standard has led some manufacturers to create their own types.
