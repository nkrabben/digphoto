Time is a complex. A camera clock will keep an accurate count of seconds, as long as its backup battery has power. It may even factor in Daylight Saving, leap seconds, and other administrative aspects of time keeping depending on how complex the software is for the clock. Although most cameras will prompt a user to update the time when they're first turned on, it can't guarantee the user does that correctly.

It also can't guarantee that the user updates the time zone correctly. If it has a GPS chip, it may be possible to include either UTC or automatic time zone changes, but that's not guaranteed. Pictures take on commercial airliners are wrong.

Camera manufacturers have many methods to record the time as well. Embedded metadata, filenames, metadata sidecars. Each of these locations can record time differently.
