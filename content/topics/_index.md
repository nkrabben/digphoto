### [File Formats](/topics/file-formats/)
*Coming soon* - JPEG, TIFF, RAW formats (CR3, NEF, ARW, DNG, etc.), video containers (MP4, MOV, MXF), and proprietary formats.

### [Embedded Metadata](/topics/embedded-metadata/)
*Coming soon* - EXIF, IPTC, XMP standards, maker notes, GPS data, and metadata extraction techniques.

### [Image and Video Encoding](/topics/encodings/)
*Coming soon* - JPEG compression, RAW formats, bit depth, color depth, and quality indicators. H.264, H.265/HEVC, ProRes, codec timeline by manufacturer, and forensic dating via codec.

## Multi-File Relationships
